#  Solar Power Prediction using XGBoost & Transformer Model 

Welcome to the **Solar Power Prediction** project! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that leverages **XGBoost** and a **Transformer-based model** for accurate one-hour-ahead solar power forecasting. 

---

##  Features
✅ **Univariate & Multivariate Analysis** for feature selection 
✅ **Hybrid Approach:** XGBoost & Transformer Model   
✅ **Scikit-learn Preprocessing** for better data handling 🏗️  
✅ **Google Colab Integration** for cloud-based execution 🚀  
✅ **Matplotlib & Pandas** for data visualization & analysis 📉

## 🛠️ Installation
Before running the notebook, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib xgboost scikit-learn torch transformers

🔹 If using Google Colab, mount Google Drive:
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

📌 Usage
Follow these steps to get started:

1️⃣ Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Duncan1738/Solar-Power-Prediction-using-XGBoost-Transformer-Mode.git

2️⃣ Open Solar Power Prediction using XGBoost & Transformer Model.ipynb in Jupyter or Google Colab
3️⃣ Run the cells step by step
4️⃣ Train & evaluate both the XGBoost and Transformer model

📊 Data Handling
This notebook loads data from Google Drive. If running locally, update the file paths accordingly.

🔹 One-Hot Encoding & Feature Scaling applied for optimal performance
🔹 Time-Series Solar Power Data processed for better forecasting

🤖 Model Overview
✨ Algorithms:

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
Transformer Model (Deep Learning for Time-Series Forecasting)
✨ Task: Regression (Predicting future solar power values)

✨ Performance Metrics:

🔹 Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
🔹 Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
🔹 R² Score (Coefficient of determination)
🔹 Transformer model allows learning long-range dependencies in time-series data
🔹 Hyperparameter tuning is available for both models! 🛠️
